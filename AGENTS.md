# Repository Guidance

This repository contains a single-binary Rust CLI located in `src/main.rs`.
Unit and integration tests are defined in that file as well.

When modifying Rust source code in this project:

1. Format the code with `cargo fmt --all`.
2. Run the full test suite using `cargo test`.

Ensure both steps succeed before committing changes.
